## python automatically understand type of data  we dont need to specify it like other language we just have to write and it understand it based on sytax

'''Set'''
#Unordered cause it removes duplicate value dont keep order which we have given
# mutable collection
# stores unique element
a={1,3,3,4,2,3,4}
b={3,3,6,7,7,8}
print(a)
print(type(a))


'''frozen set'''
# simillar to set but immutable
fs = frozenset([1,4,6,7,6,4])
